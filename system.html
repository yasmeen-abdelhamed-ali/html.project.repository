                    Computer is an electronic machine that makes performing any task very easy. In computer, the CPU executes each instruction provided to it, in a series of steps, this series of steps is called <b>Machine Cycle</b>, and is repeated for each instruction. One machine cycle involves <i>fetching of instruction, decoding the instruction, transferring the data, executing the instruction.</i>
